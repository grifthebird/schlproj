	<h1>Introduction</h1></p>
		<p>In this project, our team was tasked with designing a use case diagram
		that would depict the behavior of the terminals used by company Chocoholics
		Anonymous (abbreviated ChocAn). The solution that I devised (proj1umlv1.png)
		categorizes all of company's interactions into four categories. Those four
		categories are as follows: The Actors, the "people" that interact with the
		terminal itself; The Interface, which is the terminal that allows the actors
		to interact with one another; The Actions, which are the actions that the actors
		perform directly through the terminal; and the Subactions, which are actions
		that are performed by the terminal, but not directly available to the Actor.
		</p>
<p><h1>Glossary</h1></p>
		<p>Member: A person who uses ChocAn services, but does not interact with the ChocAn terminals.</p>
		<p>Provider: A person who provides servies to ChocAn members, and uses ChocAn terminal functions to do so.</p>
		<p><h1>Use Cases</h1><p>
		<p><strong>Use case:</strong> Member Billing<br>
		<strong>Context:</strong> The provider wants to bill a member for use of ChocAn services.<br>
		<strong>Actors:</strong> ChocAn Data Center, Provider<br>
		<strong>Main Success Scenario:</strong><br>
		1. The Provider verifies the Member's membership.<br>
		2. The terminal requests the date of service.<br>
		3. The Provider enters the date of service.<br>
		4. The Provider enters the six-digit code corresponding
		to the service provided.<br>
		5. The Provider validates that the service provided
		is correct.<br>
		1a. The verification fails<br>
		<blockquote>1a.1. The terminal displays the reason for rejection<br></blockquote>
		<blockquote>1a.2.<br></blockquote>
		5a. The service code does not exist.<br>
		<blockquote><t>5a.1. The<br></blockquote>
